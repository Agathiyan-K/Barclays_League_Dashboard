### 5. Goals Scored vs Goals Conceded by Each Team Across All Seasons
-	Manchester United, Arsenal, and Chelsea scored significantly more goals than they conceded, showcasing their dominance and well-rounded gameplay.
- Manchester City, especially in recent years, maintained an excellent balance under Pep Guardiola, scoring heavily while conceding fewer goals.
- Teams like Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool scored heavily but conceded more than the top teams during some seasons, reflecting a more aggressive, less defensive style of play.
-Relegation-prone teams, such as Sunderland, Huddersfield Town, and Fulham, struggled to maintain a balance, conceding far more goals than they scored, contributing to their poor league performances.

### 6. Wins vs Goals Scored Relationship
- There is a clear positive correlation between the number of wins and goals scored. Teams that score more goals tend to have more wins, demonstrating the importance of an attacking strategy in securing victories.
- Teams with higher win counts in a season (especially the title contenders) tend to score significantly more goals.
- The teams that win most matches (like Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea) are generally positioned in the top-right quadrant of the chart, where both wins and goals scored are high. This reflects their dominance in both offensive and competitive aspects.
- A few teams (typically those in mid-table) might show high goals scored but relatively lower wins. These teams often play an attacking style but may lack the defensive solidity or consistency to convert all their attacking play into victories.
The chart highlights that scoring more goals is directly linked to winning more matches. However, teams with poor defense or inconsistent performances can still fail to secure enough wins, even with a high goal count.

### 7. Wins vs Goals Conceded Relationship
- There is a negative correlation between wins and goals conceded. Teams that concede fewer goals tend to win more matches. This is a reflection of the importance of a strong defense in securing victories.
- Teams with fewer goals conceded are more likely to finish at the top of the table, as strong defense often supports consistent victories.
A clear trend emerges: teams that concede fewer goals tend to have more wins. While attacking strength is important, a leaky defense often results in lower win totals, especially for lower-placed teams.

### 8. Teams with the Fewest Appearances in the Premier League
- Swindon Town, Barnsley, Swindon Town, and Huddersfield Town are some of the teams with the fewest appearances, often due to their relegations after short periods in the Premier League. Their time in the league was marked by struggles to maintain top-flight status.

### 9. Top 10 Teams with the Most Top 3 Finishes
- Manchester United dominates this list, having secured the most top 3 finishes across the seasons, with a significant number of title wins (13) under Sir Alex Ferguson. Their dominance in the Premier League throughout the 1990s and 2000s has made them a constant fixture in the top 3.
- Arsenal also features prominently, consistently finishing in the top 3, with their most notable achievement being the Invincibles season (2003/04) when they finished unbeaten. Their ability to finish in the top 3 even in seasons without titles demonstrates their sustained excellence.
- Chelsea ranks highly, especially post-2003, after the club's acquisition by Roman Abramovich. With multiple league titles and consistent top 3 finishes, Chelsea became one of the most dominant teams in the Premier League during the 2000s and 2010s.
- Liverpool has had a resurgence in the past decade, especially under Jürgen Klopp, pushing them to secure multiple top 3 finishes in recent years. Their consistent competitiveness in the Premier League reflects their solid performances.
- Manchester City rapidly rose to the top after 2008 and has been a top contender ever since, particularly under Pep Guardiola. Their dominant performances in the past decade, with numerous top 3 finishes, reflect their transformation into one of the best teams in the league.
- Tottenham Hotspur has been a frequent contender in the top 6 and has managed several top 3 finishes, though they have struggled to win the league. Their consistent performance over the years, especially under Mauricio Pochettino, has earned them multiple top 3 finishes.
These teams have not only won titles but also maintained their competitiveness, consistently securing spots in the top 3, marking them as the dominant forces in English football.

### 10. Top 10 Teams with the Most Losses
- Clubs like Sunderland, and Newcastle United have faced multiple relegations and promotions, which means their record includes a significant number of losses, especially in seasons where they struggled to adapt to the competitive Premier League environment.
- The chart underscores that teams struggling in the Premier League—whether due to defensive frailties, offensive weaknesses, or lack of consistency—often accumulate a high number of losses, leading to relegation or mid-table mediocrity. Relegated teams typically dominate this list, highlighting the gap between the Premier League's top clubs and those fighting to survive.

### 12. Goals Scored vs League Position Across All Seasons
- Teams finishing in the top positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd) consistently score more goals compared to teams finishing in lower positions. Generally, the higher a team finishes, the more goals they score. This is especially true for title-winning and top-4 teams.
- Mid-table teams (positions 8–12) generally score between 40–60 goals. These teams tend to have a balanced approach but lack the attacking power of the top teams. While they score a reasonable number of goals, they often struggle in other areas, like defense or consistency, which impacts their overall standing.
- Relegation-threatened teams (positions 18–20) tend to score fewer than 40 goals per season. Scoring fewer goals is a clear indicator of poor offensive output, which is a significant factor contributing to their lower league positions and relegation.

- Manchester City has made a significant leap in recent seasons, particularly under Pep Guardiola. Their dominance in the 2010s has seen them rack up high win totals, reflecting their tactical superiority and consistency at the top level.
- Teams like Chelsea and Arsenal have experienced fluctuations in the number of wins due to managerial changes. However, their top finishes and successful seasons still place them among the top teams in terms of overall victories.
- Teams like Tottenham Hotspur and Everton also appear on the list, reflecting their ability to consistently secure wins, especially in mid-table seasons. Though they have not won as many titles, their steady performances ensure they stay competitive year after year.

### 14. Total Goals Scored by each Teams Across All Seasons (just a graph to denote how goal scored varies across season)
- There is significant variation in the total goals scored by teams across seasons. While some teams maintain a consistently high scoring rate, others see peaks and troughs in their offensive performance due to changes in squad quality, tactics, or managerial approach.
- Teams at the bottom of the table or relegated sides consistently show low goal counts, often failing to break the 40-goal mark. These teams typically lack the offensive quality or consistency to score enough goals to survive in the Premier League.
- The chart shows how offensive output varies greatly across teams and seasons. High-performing teams in recent years, especially those managed by tacticians focusing on attacking play, have seen a noticeable increase in their total goals scored, while relegated and lower-ranked teams continue to struggle with poor goal-scoring records.

### 15. Word Cloud Highlighting the Best Teams

### 18. Average Points Secured Per Team Across All Seasons
- Teams finishing in the top 4 consistently average over 70 points per season. Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, and Liverpool have historically maintained high point averages, reflecting their dominance in the league and consistent performances.
- Teams in the mid-table (positions 9-12) typically average between 40–55 points. These teams often show a level of consistency but lack the quality to challenge for higher positions. Their points can fluctuate, depending on whether they have strong or weak seasons.
- Relegated teams consistently show the lowest average points, often under 40 points. This is a reflection of their inability to secure enough wins and draws to avoid relegation. Teams like Derby County and Sunderland are examples of clubs that struggled to reach even 30 points in certain seasons.
